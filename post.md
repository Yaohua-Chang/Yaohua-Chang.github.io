My name is Yaohua Chang. Now I am pursuing Master degree of Data Science and Engineering in City College of New York. I am looking for an internship concerning data science and software development in this winter holiday. I am confident in my ability to perform as a Data Engineering intern due to my extensive education and work experience.  

During one-semester education at City College of New York, I had an intensive study including selecting features, optimizing classifiers, mining data, expanding the companyâ€™s data by incorporating third-party sources, improving data collection techniques, processing data, and doing ad-hoc analyses. As a Data Engineer, I was required to have excellent communication skills, understanding of algorithms, excellence in the R and Python, proficiency in ggplot, knowledge of SQL, and excellence in applied statistics.  

I believe my personality has also played a major role in my ability to succeed in this career. I am an extremely analytical, data-oriented, and calculated. Even in my personal life I like to look at the data before making a decision. I like to analyze outcomes.  

I would like to thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward to hearing more about your company and the details of the Data Engineering position. I feel that my education and experience will ensure my success in this internship.
